         specification.</p>

         <h2>2.1.3.7. The <code class="markup">aria-describedat</code> Attribute</h2>
         <p>The <a href="#sec-xhtml-aria-describedat"><code>aria-describedat</code> attribute</a> was added to EPUB 3.0.1 to
            provide a mechanism for associating external descriptions with images, tables and other complex content. The
            attribute was included in early drafts ARIA 1.1, but has subsequently been removed due to objections and will not
            be reintroduced in the future. Without a formal definition, the attribute will not be valid in HTML5 content and
            will not be supported by assistive technologies.</p>
         <p>As a result, authors of EPUB Publications are strongly urged not to use this attribute to associate descriptions.
            The attribute can only be deprecated from EPUB 3.0.1 since it is already a formal specification, but it will be
            permanently removed in the next revision.</p>
         <p>Authors are encouraged to use other web-compliant methods for associating external descriptions, such as
            hyperlinks to non-linear content documents and using <code>aria-describedby</code> to point to a hidden iframe
            element that references the description.</p>
         <p>Other web-friendly alternatives not currently available in EPUB 3, such as the <code>longdesc</code> attribute
            and <code>details</code> element, will be considered in the next revision.</p>

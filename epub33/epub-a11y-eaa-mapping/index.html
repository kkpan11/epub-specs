			<p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882">European
					Accessibility Act (EAA)</a> is an EU directive that establishes binding accessibility requirements that
				must be met by many different types of products and services to strengthen the rights of people with
				disabilities to access goods and services, including ebooks, dedicated reading software, ereading
				devices, digital rights management softwares, and ecommerce.</p>

			<p>The EAA has been approved on 27 June 2019 and will come into force from 28 June 2025.</p>

			<p>This note aims to demonstrate that EPUB® standard meets all the technical requirements related
				to ebooks defined by the European Accessibility Act.</p>

			<p>The methodology used is mapping the requirements of the EU Accessibility Act related to ebooks to the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/">EPUB Accessibility</a> specification.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="introduction">
			<h2>How EPUB conforming to EPUB accessibility guidelines cover European Accessibility Act requirements</h2>

			<p>EPUB is the standard format for the creation and distribution of publications in the digital publishing sector.</p>

			<p>The specifications of the EPUB standard are based on the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform">Open Web Platform</a>: HTML, CSS, XML, MathML and
				SVG are the core technologies used for content creation. This means that EPUB
				publications can be created with a high degree of accessibility simply through the proper application of
				established digital accessibility techniques.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/">EPUB Accessibility</a> specifications [epub-a11y-11] address the following key areas for making fully accessible EPUB publications:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>discoverability of accessibility features of publications;</li>
				<li>conformance to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines;</li>
				<li>specific EPUB requirements for accessibility;</li>
				<li>evaluation and conformance reporting of accessible EPUB publications.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The EPUB Accessibility defines requirements for accessibility metadata. In this way consumers can examine the accessibility characteristics of the content and make well-informed decisions on whether an EPUB publication is appropriate for each need before buying, borrowing or downloading it.
				This metadata, attached to the digital file and distributed along the supply chain, ensures that persons with disabilities can be informed about the publication accessibility features.
				In order to make sure that information gets to the end user, it is critical that all players in the value chain do their part in managing metadata and displaying it to the end user (aggregators, ecommerce, reading solutions).</p>

			<p>EPUB Accessibility also defines the official accessibility criteria that EPUBs must adhere to claim conformance to the standard.
				These criteria offer EPUB creators a precise set of instructions to assess their content in terms of quality assurance.</p>
			
			<p>The EPUB Accessibility does not target a single version of EPUB (most commercially available publications
				are in EPUB 3 or EPUB 2 format). It is designed to be applicable to all EPUB publications conforming to
				any version or profile, including future versions of the standard.</p>
				
			<p>The EPUB allows to create both reflowable and Fixed Layout publications.</p>
			
			<p>In a reflowable EPUB the content adapts to the user's viewport, depending also on the user's chosen graphical characteristics, such as font size, line spacing, text color, etc.; while in Fixed Layout EPUBs each element is positioned absolutely on the page (as it is usually an exact replica of the paper version) and the user has not the ability to change the text formatting.</p>

			<p>EPUB Fixed Layout are mainly used for publications in which the meaning is layout-driven such as comics, illustrated children’s books and art books.</p>

			<p>Although it is technically possible to produce Fixed Layout publications with a good level of accessibility, it should be kept in mind that some accessibility requirements cannot be met, precisely because of the limitation of the format, such as the ability to change the graphical formatting of the text according to the user's needs.</p>

				<h2>Relationship of EPUB Acessibility to WCAG</h2>
				
				<p>EPUB Accessibility specification defines the requirements necessary to make an EPUB publication fully accessible including to the ones defined by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and adding the ones related with the specific characteristic of ebooks and digital publications.</p>

				<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) offer a broad framework of requirements for making digital content accessible to all, addressing a wide range of problems and providing solutions. WCAG guidelines cover several aspects, including multimedia content, interactive content, and basic web page structure.</p>
				
				<p>EPUB Accessibility specification not only defines how to apply WCAG specifically to EPUB publications, but adds additional requirements such as accessibility metadata, page navigation, audio-text synchronization and Digital Rights Management guidance.</p>
			
				<p>The additional requirements set by EPUB Accessibility specification are critical to fully comply with the requirements of the European Accessibility Act.</p>
